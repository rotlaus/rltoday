#summary Common Registry Keys

This is by no means complete. There are too many WM devices for this to be accurate for them all. Y = confirmed yes, N = confirmed no, blank = unconfirmed. Note that a confirmed no may be inaccurate due to third-party software or relience on optional hardware.

Note the keys below may be shown with a space or line break between the top level, e.g. HKEY_CURRENT_USER and the first "\". This white space is there for the web page only and needs to be removed when used on the PDA.

WiFi hardware present?\\ 2 = powered on\\ 4 = networks available\\ 8 = connecting\\ 16 = connected\\ \\ Bit 4 (Networks Available) can be set when wifi is off. On inspection, this bit appears to mean that you have a configured wifi network. So if this bit is true, then enabling wifi will probably result in an internet connection (Depending on location of course) || || Y || Y ||
